# About Me 

My name is Jon Reisher, and I am pursuing my master's degree in public policy and management at Carnegie Mellon University. I am origionally from Washington State but have lived all over the United States. I enjoy doing anything outdoors including hiking, fishing, and skiing. I also enjoy sports such as baseball, American football, and rugby. I really enjoy traveling and my favorite place I have been to so far is Jordan.

I hope to one day work in international development space or for a policy related think tank.

## What I hope to Learn!

I hope to learn more about geospatial analysis and how to create customizable maps. I really enjoyed the introductory GIS class and used several GIS skills in my summer internship as a researcher for #JustRecovery, a study on the impact of COVID19 on marginalized communities in Toronto, Pittsburgh, and Atlanta. I was on the Toronto team. One key area we tried to analyze was access to health care. For a variety of reasons, healthcare-related data is protected in Canada. However, using a basic walkability analysis around Toronto Hospitals and clinics and overlayed that on a polygon feature class of 'visibly black' population in Toronto demonstrated the immense lack of health care access for racial minorities. Having the capability to use geospatial analysis to fill in for lack of data was immensely helpful for creating a well-rounded research project.
